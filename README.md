# mz-popular-movies
Android project for the Associate Android Developer Certificate by Udacity/Google.

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

Once you obtain your key, you assign it to PARAM_KEY_VALUE in
\app\src\main\java\com\michaelzap94\mzpopularmovies\Utilities\NetworkCatcher.java

After assigning your API KEY, the application will work fine.
